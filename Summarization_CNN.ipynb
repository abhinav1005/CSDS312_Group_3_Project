            "'>> Article: By . Claire Ellicott . PUBLISHED: . 12:18 EST, 2 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:38 EST, 3 May 2013 . Perhaps it’s all down  to her fledgling romance  with her dashing stock- broker boyfriend. Or maybe it has something to do with her younger brother James’s new relationship with television presenter Donna Air. Whatever the case, love was clearly on Pippa Middleton’s mind when she wrote her most recent recipe instalment for Waitrose – a ‘romantic picnic for two’. In the piece, the socialite sister of the Duchess of Cambridge extols the benefits of ‘whisk[ing] away someone special for an evening of gazing and grazing’. Picnic time: If your name happens to be Pippa . Middleton, the humble strawberry jam sandwich simply . doesn't cut the mustard on a spring picnic, as you'll discover in the new edition of Waitrose Kitchen . The 29-year-old’s Provencal Picnic menu includes peach and vanilla fizz, a fig and goat’s cheese fougasse – a type of bread associated with Provence – smoked chicken and melon salad and strawberry and lavender cheesecake jars. But frankly it would be cheaper – never mind easier – to head to a nice restaurant. Because to buy all the ingredients from Waitrose and cook the meal from scratch would cost almost £100 for two people. That figure is based on the first  relevant choices available on the supermarket’s website, ranked in terms of popularity. If you follow Miss Middleton’s advice, you would also need to  invest in tea towels ‘with French stripes’, enamel plates  and quilted rugs, adding £85  to the total. For the utmost authenticity, you’d need to fly to Provence, too – a snip at £1,014 for two people, based on a return flight with British Airways. Even without a trip away, anyone attempting their own version of her latest ‘Friday Night Feast’ would be advised to take the day off – it takes at least two and a half hours to prepare. Fragrant: One of Pippa's recipes calls for dried lavender. Unfortunately, the flower is not available at Waitrose . Tasty: According to Pippa, her strawberry and lavender cheesecake jars will be a hit with your man . Despite this Miss Middleton, who is dating stockbroker  Nico Jackson, 35, still advises readers to ‘quickly prep, pack, then whisk away someone special’. Her tips are unlikely to go down well with hard-working mothers, or indeed anyone who works full-time. Miss Middleton became  the face of Waitrose after the company ditched Delia Smith when her three-year contract ended in January. Her first column for Waitrose Kitchen magazine caused controversy because of the price of the ingredients involved. In this month’s column, her second, Miss Middleton waxes lyrical as she describes how her menu is inspired by Provence. She writes: ‘Here’s my vision of the perfect picnic. I’m in Provence, in a field just off the beaten track, where we’ve parked the car and thrown a quilted rug across the dry, parched grasses. Fight back: Delia has said she won't cook any of Pippa's recipes, as featured in Waitrose Kitchen magazine . ‘The hazy sky is cobalt blue, cicadas hum around us and it’s hot, very hot. But not too hot for a picnic. 'Around us are plump peaches, figs and strawberries, oozing ripe cheeses and crunchy baguettes, torn and ready to mop up every last morsel.’ A spokesman for Waitrose said  the menu cost £57.13, based on its own calculations. That figure used prices for whole packs of ingredients. It added up to £23.83 if only the quantities required were taken into account. She added: ‘Typically many of our customers would have some of the basic store cupboard ingredients – so their shopping lists would be considerably cheaper. 'Our shoppers are savvy and will typically shop across our different ranges when buying ingredients for recipes.’ She said that the Daily Mail had chosen ‘many of the expensive options’. The Mail chose the most popular items, in the smallest size packs available. PEACH AND VANILLA FIZZ . 'A subtle aperitif with a hint of lemon and vanilla,' says Pippa. 'The base can be topped up with lemonade instead of sparkling water or wine, and any leftovers can be frozen in ice cube trays for another day - they'll keep in the freezer for up to a month.

She's more frequently seen sporting airtex T-shirts, sensible skirts, crisp white caps and comfortable trainers. And she's been wearing that outfit every day on the golfing green since she was just four years old. But America's young female golfing sensation Michelle Wie swapped her usual attire for a stunning Matthew Williamson gown at an Olympics party at London's Omega House last night. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Then and now: A thirteen-year-old Wie takes a shot on the green, left, then changes (a decade later) into an elegant Matthew Williamson gown for last night's Olympic party in London . Attending the party with fellow golfer Jeehae Lee, from South Korea, 22-year-old Wie looked sensational in the embellished red and nude floor-length sleeveless dress, which featured elaborate asymmetrical detail, a high neckline and a racy, thigh-high slit. The golfer - who has played the sport in her native Hawaii since she was just four years old, and became the youngest player ever to qualify for a United States Golf Association (USGA) amateur championship aged 10 - excitedly tweeted about her evening at Omega House. Posting photos of herself and Lee on the social networking site, Wie wrote: 'This is inside one of the rooms at the house. @jeehaeda and I matching colors. Ha. How do we look?'

            "She was the last person off the plane and was met by police .\n",
            "U.S. authorities mistook the girl, who lacked identification, for a Colombian national .'\n",
            "'>> Article: (CNN) -- Jakadrien Turner has arrived back in Texas, eight months after she was mistakenly deported to Colombia, the pilot and a flight attendant on a Dallas-bound flight told CNN. The 15-year-old girl was the last person off the plane Friday evening, according to CNN's Jason Morris, who was on the flight. Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport police officers escorted her off the aircraft. Turner wound up being deported to Bogota, Colombia, in May 2011 after U.S. authorities last year mistook the girl, an apparent teenage runaway who lacked identification, for a Colombian national. The Colombian Institute for Family Welfare confirmed Thursday that Turner was then in its custody, is pregnant and entered the country as an adult. The institute said that Colombian authorities learned a month ago that this female may in fact be a 15-year-old American citizen, after which she was placed in a protection program there. She left Colombia at 10:30 a.m. Friday, according to U.S. State Department spokesman William Ostick, who noted that the U.S. Embassy in Bogota worked closely with Colombian officials as well as authorities in Texas to bring Turner's case to a resolution. The girl who called herself Tika Cortez . \"It's a giant step. I'm relieved, but I won't be completely relieved until I get her in my arms again,\" the girl's mother said. \"A weight has definitely been lifted.\" Johnisa Turner has not yet talked with her daughter, who ran away from home in the fall of 2010, but said she is relieved to know she is located. So, too, is the girl's grandmother Lorene Turner, who said U.S. Embassy officials called with the news that her granddaughter would be turned over to U.S. officials. \"When I heard those words, I didn't hear nothing else. I flipped out. I can't wait,\" she said. After the girl went missing, the family tracked her to Houston, where she worked at a music club under a different name. They tried to get help from authorities there, to no avail. They later learned she was in Colombia, partying and smoking marijuana, and a detective told them she was pregnant. Jakadrien's family is still demanding to know why immigration authorities deported the teen -- a U.S. citizen with no knowledge of Spanish -- and why they simply took her at her word when she gave them a fake name. The family's attorney, Ray Jackson, told CNN on Friday the family believes the girl's civil rights were violated when authorities allowed her to be deported. He said that lawsuits against the agencies who dealt with her case are in the works, he said. \"Somewhere the ball was dropped,\" Jackson said. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency maintains she was arrested in Houston for theft and told them she was an adult from Colombia. The agency says authorities believed her story because she maintained her false identity throughout the process. They handed her over to an immigration judge, who ordered her removed from the country. \"At no time during these criminal proceedings was her identity determined to be false,\" the agency says. It says criminal database searches and biometric verification revealed no information to invalidate her claims. Jackson says it doesn't make sense, explaining that the immigration agency took her fingerprints but failed to match them to the name she gave. The agency says it is taking the allegations very seriously and is \"fully and immediately investigating the matter in order to expeditiously determine the facts of the case.\" Pictures of the teen taken in Colombia showed her sitting on men's laps smoking marijuana, her grandmother said. But she appeared to be reaching out for help, she said, listing on Facebook the names of everyone at parties, perhaps so she could be traced. Her family's lawyer says he doesn't believe that the girl was trying to fake her way out of the United States by adopting a false identity throughout the process. \"I don't buy that she had the wherewithal to be able to bamboozle the government,\" Jackson says. \"You know, kids are scared when they get around authorities. ... To think that you could bamboozle them to create a new identity, it just doesn't make sense.\" Colombia's foreign ministry said Thursday it was investigating what sort of verification its consulate in Texas requested before giving the girl an expedited provisional passport as part of deportation proceedings, as well as how she got work authorization for training at a call center as part of the government's \"Welcome Home\" program. Attorneys with the program made a sworn declaration in front of a notary pointing to \"inexact information\" that allowed her to receive work papers, the foreign ministry said. \"Those lawyers are no longer providing services to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\" the statement said. Ed Lavandera, Jorge Asdrubal Garcia Romero, Luis Carlos Velez, Jamie Crawford and Nick Valencia contributed to this report.'\n"
